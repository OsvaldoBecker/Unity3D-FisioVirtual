#### Compiled for Windows:
- It has the UI in Brazilian Portuguese.
- It has 8 exercises, including unilateral and bilateral exercises, and in standing and sitting positions.
- It has alert notifications when doing the exercise wrongly and an error counter per exercise.
- It has the history menu to see the users' exercise history and the total number of exercises performed.
- It has a configuration menu for the exercises (rest time, order of execution and more) and even the time (day or night, duration of each and more).

#### Important:
- Some exercises have somewhat complex moves for the skeleton tracking technology used.
- The Nuitrack license used is not the one that allows for the most accurate skeleton tracking.
